# Inspiration
Since starting on a side-quest into social media therapy, I felt it was important to log and reference as there are a lot of unvalidated or "experts" that may not be actual board or licenced in the advice they may give or the courses they provide.

ADHD Coaching is a partnership between a client and ADHD coach. Together they target the core struggles of ADHD, helping the client to close the gap of where they currently are and where they would like to be. ADHD coaches have knowledge and life experience of ADHD, as well as necessary training to help the client identify and reach their goals effectively. Studies show that coaching can significantly improve ADHD symptoms and executive functioning.

[About](https://thedepressionproject.com/about)

``
[Mathew Baker] To become a therapist, there’s a pretty standard path you’re expected to follow – study for 5 or 6 years, get your qualifications, and then begin working one-on-one with clients. I started along this path studying a Bachelor’s in Psychology, but the deeper I got into it, the more I grew disheartened by the industry I’d originally dreamed of entering. This disenchantment continued to grow while I did my Master’s of Counselling, and it grew even more so in my early years after graduating, when I worked in a range of settings including in drug and alcohol rehabilitation, with at-risk youth, and in a homeless refuge. By that point in time, my problems with the industry had become crystal clear.
