# Inspiration
Since going on a side-quest social media therapy journey, I felt it was important to log and reference as there are a lot of unvalidated or "experts" that may not be actual board or licenced in the advice they may give or the courses they provide.

*One founder persued a path to become a therapist, but ultimately became a counselor instead based below, other is a depression survivor

[About](https://thedepressionproject.com/about)

``
[Mathew Baker] To become a therapist, there’s a pretty standard path you’re expected to follow – study for 5 or 6 years, get your qualifications, and then begin working one-on-one with clients. I started along this path studying a Bachelor’s in Psychology, but the deeper I got into it, the more I grew disheartened by the industry I’d originally dreamed of entering. This disenchantment continued to grow while I did my Master’s of Counselling, and it grew even more so in my early years after graduating, when I worked in a range of settings including in drug and alcohol rehabilitation, with at-risk youth, and in a homeless refuge. By that point in time, my problems with the industry had become crystal clear.
``

### Other Notes
- Mathew Baker is stated as head of Content creation, indicating IG posts are probably from him
- Pushes courses a ton of courses and books
- Has an agenda.
